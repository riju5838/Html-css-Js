<dt>AI:-</dt><br>
<dd><P>Artificial Intelligence refers to the intelligence of machines. This is in contrast to the natural intelligence of humans and animals. With Artificial Intelligence, machines perform functions such as learning, planning, reasoning and problem-solving. Most noteworthy, Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It is probably the fastest-growing development in the World of technology and innovation. Furthermore, many experts believe AI could solve major challenges and crisis situations.</P></DD>

<dt>ROBOTS:-</dt>
<dd><p>People have been interested in building machines to do work for us for a long time. But it takes time and money to build just one machine, so early ideas were not built. Leonardo da Vinci designed a man-shaped machine to look like a knight in 1464. It would be controlled with ropes and wheels. Other engineers and dreamers drew mechanical men. In 1920, Karel ÄŒapek wrote a story about them, and he used a word from Czech that is connected with 'work': robot.[3]

The most successful robot designs in the 20th century were not made to look like people. They were designed for use. George Devol made the first of these, the Unimate, in 1954, with one arm and one hand. General Motors bought it in 1960. The next year, it started work in a factory in New Jersey, lifting and stacking pieces of metal that were too hot for people to touch.[4] The engineers could program it, and reprogram it if they had to.</p></dd>
